            <h2>My Testimony</h2>
            <p>Over the time serving a mission I learned many valuable lessons that I apply into my life today. I took away three main lessons of the many that there were and want to bare testimony of them here. I learned that being diligent is essential to success in this life in order to help others come unto Christ, but also to succeed in a professional career. This attribute of Christ is something that we all need in order to progress here on earth. I also learned a great deal about my testimony of the restoration of the gospel. When I started I honestly wasnâ€™t sure if this church was restored and frankly what that meant. Through baring testimony of these things each day and preach of what Joseph Smith saw I now know that he was a prophet of God. Maybe the most important lesson I learned was living the doctrine of Jesus Christ. We all need to follow these steps of faith, repentance, baptism, receive the holy ghost and endure to the end but we need to live them every day. We need to keep our covenants and repent daily as we come closer to the savior each day.</p>
            <p>Serving a mission changed my life forever. Because of it I can now say that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day saints is the only true church here on earth. I know that through the ordinances and covenants we make in the church that we can return back to the Father someday  and live with our families forever. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>
